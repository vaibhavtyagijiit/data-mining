            <h1>What is Data Mining?</h1>
          </div>

          <p>Data mining is the process of analyzing data to pull out more information and generating useful information from a large data set. This data that is extrapolated can be used to find trends and hidden findings that can cut costs or find a new revenue source. Software has been built to help with this process by allowing users to group data and manipulate data to find these trends. Data mining is used in almost all businesses to learn more from there data than just the obvious.</p>

        <section id="process">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>Process</h1>
          </div>

            <p>The art of data mining comes through a variety of known processes, all of which involve three standard ideas including pre-processing, data mining and the interpretation and validation of the results.</p>

            <h3>Pre-Processing</h3>
            <p>During data pre-processing actions such as cleaning, integration, transformation and reduction are performed to create a training set to complete data mining with.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cleaning Data - Is the removal of incomplete, incorrect and corrupted entries from the data set in which data mining will occur. It is completed in effort to remove outliers and inconsistencies to improve data modeling.</li>
                <li>Integration of Data – The combination of data from multiple sources into one coherent data warehouse.</li>
                <li>Data Transformation – Data is transformed facilitate the data mining process by normalization, smoothing to remove noise, aggregation to compound data and generalization into hierarchal structure.</li>
                <li>Data Reduction – Reduction of amount of data to be analyzed without sacrificing the integrity of the original data while continuously producing the same quality results.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Classification – Maps data into one of several predefined classes to show trends and groups.</li>
                <li>Regression – Maps data to a real-valued prediction variable. It can be used to make estimates based on the data relationships to predetermined variables.</li>
                <li>Summarization – Finds calculated or derived values that exist within subsets of data. Ex. Total Expenses</li>
                <li>Dependency – Consists of finding dependencies between variables. These dependencies can be shown both at structural level (graphical) and quantitative level (numeric)</li>
                <li>Clustering – Finds similarities existing in data by using known structures and groups or clusters accordingly.
Interpretation and Validation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Interpretation and Validation</h3>
            <p>Interpretation and Validation are the comparison and assessment between collected data mining models to real data. They are used to ensure accuracy and infer the conclusions of the data mining.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Statistical Tests – Determines if the data and data model are statistically valid.</li>
                <li>Separation Testing – Data is divided into testing and training sets to test the accuracy of the predictions created by the data model.</li>
                <li>Business Testing – Determines if the discovered patterns within the data model hold their meaning within practical business scenarios. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The most industry applied data mining methodology is Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), favored by 43% according to a 2007 census completed by KDnuggets.com, a website focused on the data mining community. The 6 phases commonly associated with CRISP-DM are:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Business Understanding</li>
                <li>Data Understanding</li>
                <li>Data Preparation</li>
                <li>Modeling</li>
                <li>Evaluation</li>
                <li>Deployment</li>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h1>Standards</h1>
            </div>

            <p>There have been many attempts to create a standards body for data mining but all have faded out for one reason or another.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining</li>
                <li>Java Data Mining</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Variations of these standards were active until 2006 but, never reached a final draft. There are still standards out there that are used in the industry.  For exchanging models they use the Predictive Model Markup Language, which is XML based. The language was developed by the Data Mining Group and is a standard used by many applications today.</p>

                <h1>Software</h1>
            </div>

            <p>Many large companies produce data mining software for use internally and to sell.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft – Microsoft Analysis Services</li>
                <li>Oracle – Oracle Data Mining</li>
                <li>IBM - IBM SPSS Modeler</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are also many free and open source solutions in many languages such as Java, Python, C++. Many of these open source projects have moved towards the web as well, generating their reports to HTML.</p>

          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>Pivacy Concerns</h1>
          </div>

            <p>With Data mining being the wave of the future, one has to ask their self, what are some of the cons of this process? The primary concern of most citizens is the privacy loss associated with having all of their personal information stored in a database, and potentially without their permission. As more companies are taking advantage of data mining, some of these companies may ask your permission for storing your personal information, however many will not. In this highly competitive digital age, many companies will have the dilemma of if they should ask your permission to put your personal information in this database but risk losing some of their competitive advantage, or if they should just put it in this database regardless to try and stay on top of their competition. In the coming years this will become a bigger issue, such as with how gmail will go through your email and tailor your search results and advertisements to the content of your private emails.</p>

            <p>Another example of this is how Target will tailor their ads to each individual customer. Based on an article in Forbes magazine, there was a teen girl who started receiving advertisements that an expecting mother would expect to receive. She started to receive these advertisements and coupons based on the data that Target had collected from this individual’s purchases. This individual’s mother was then upset about why Target would be sending her daughter coupons that an expecting mother would expect to receive, and called Target to ask for an explanation.  The man on the other end of the phone said he didn’t know, so when the mother confronted the daughter she realized that there was some activity going on in her house that she was unaware of and apologized to the Target representative. Since then target has changed how they send out ads, making them in booklets of other seemingly random advertisements that the mother would never be interested in. </p>

            <p>This is just one example of how data mining can be highly intrusive to someone’s privacy, knowing very personal information about the consumers just through their buying activity. In the future this can be expected to be a growing concern as more and more companies are taking more active rolls in data mining.</p>

            <h1>Business Applications</h1>
          </div>

          <p>Businesses use data mining to analyze large amounts of data very rapidly. Analyzing data rapidly allows business to find trends and patterns within their data that could be helpful in creating more profitable and more efficient business functions. According to the article, “Data Mining for Business Applications,” Banking industries use data mining for customer segmentation. Gathering large quantities of customer data and then analyzing the data can help banks identify certain trends in certain transactions such as customer deposits, withdrawals, loans, etc. In his article “Data Mining,” Doug Alexander defines data mining as having specific uses for businesses. Alexander explains that data mining can be used specifically for market segmentation, customer churn, fraud detection, direct and interactive marketing, and market basket and trend analysis. Alexander describes market basket analysis as using data mining to find relationships between products and services. Overall businesses benefit from these uses of data mining and use the data, such as trends, patters, relationships, etc., compiled from data mining to make better decisions to elevate their business. </p>
